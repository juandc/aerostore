AeroStore - Aerolab Challenge


## About
The challenge is to build a catalog view for a loyalty program app.
Aerolab will provide the base UI and API, it can be used as provided or make with any improvements you deem fit. 

The base UI will not provide a responsive version of the app, its optional to do something about it or not, though I think its completely obligatory.

The product’s main goal is to help users redeem items through a points-based system. It’s expected the end-product to be both visually attractive and functionally effective.


## Setup
This challenge is composed by two services: the **_redesigned_** api service and the web (frontend) service.
